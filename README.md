Shellfun
========

These are some configuration scripts that I've used in my home
directory for many years.

Installation
------------

* `wget -O - http://bit.ly/shellfun | /bin/sh`
* `python3 -c "import sys,urllib.request; sys.stdout.buffer.write(urllib.request.urlopen('http://bit.ly/shellfun').read())"`

*WARNING*: this will overwrite files in your home directory, so make
sure you have a backup.
