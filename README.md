Shellfun
========

These are some configuration scripts that I've used in my home
directory for many years.

Installation
------------

`wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wtanaka/shellfun/master/boot.sh |
   /bin/sh`

*WARNING*: this will overwrite files in your home directory, so make
sure you have a backup.
