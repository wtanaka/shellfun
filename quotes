To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and
refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy,
not rich; to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; to listen
to stars and birds, to babes and sages with open heart; to bear all
cheerfully, await occasions, hurry never.  In a word, to let the spiritual,
unbidden and unconscious, grow up through common.  This is to be my
symphony.  ---William Henry Channing
